# Big-Data-Analytics
This repository contains Big Data Analytics report. This project shows my ability to implement a solution for performing simple Big Data Analytics, select appropriate big data infrastructure solutions, and discuss the results in the context of a client's needs.

# Dataset
1) skill2vec 50K.csv.gz â€‚le, available from https://github.com/duyet/

2) The second file is part of the O*NET database. This database contains descriptions of jobs
and the skills they use
https://www.onetcenter.org/dl_files/database/db_27_2_text/Technology%20Skills.txt
Note that only this version (27.2) will give you the expected results.

# Summary

This project delves into the implementation and analysis of a big data solution using PySpark. The primary objectives include confirming the expected number of job descriptions, analyzing the frequency of distinct skills mentioned in job descriptions, exploring skill frequency distributions, assessing the impact of lowercasing skills, performing a join with a technology skills dataset, and identifying the most frequent "Commodity Titles" across all job descriptions. The report leverages PySpark to handle a substantial dataset of 50,000 job descriptions efficiently, showcasing the power of big data analytics in processing and extracting insights from large datasets.

Throughout the report, reusable functions and code snippets are provided to perform various data analysis tasks, from counting distinct job descriptions to analyzing skill frequencies, including handling data transformation challenges such as lowercasing.

The results of these analyses provide valuable insights for clients, offering competitive advantages in skill acquisition, informed career and talent acquisition decisions, and industry benchmarking.
